Python Programs for working with excel tabs

1. excel_tab_combiner.py
2. excel_tabrenamer.py

## 1. excel_tab_combiner.py
Combines data tables located in multiple excel tabs into one tab. Useful for appending data tables vertically.

1. Run excel_tab_combiner.py and enter the excel file input location
2. If you choose to omit first row (for tables with headers), the header row must be added manually to the output file.

## 2. excel_tab_renamer.py
Renames excel tabs based on a list of names. 
Useful for mass-renaming tabs, especially when names follow a certain pattern that can be generated by Excel (e.g. consecutive numbers, months)

1. Create a sheet named "new_names" and input the new_names in Column A (see renamer_sample.xlsx). The tabs will be renamed from left to right based on the order of names in this list (e.g. the leftmost tab will acquire the name in cell A1, and the second tab will acquire the name in cell A2...)
2. Run excel_tab_renamer.py and enter the excel file input location
3. Delete the "new_names" tab in the output file
